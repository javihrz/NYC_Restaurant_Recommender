# NYC_Restaurant_Recommender
An academic project using Python for OSU CS361 (Software Engineering I). Goal is to convert my project from a command line interface (CLI) to a graphical user interface (GUI).

Currently, the following functions are implemented:
  * Search based on cuisine type
  * Filtering based on price
  * Single random restaurant generation
  * Saving a restaurant to a favorites file
  * Saving a displayed dataset to a file
  * Comparison of two restaurants
  * Logging valid inputs
